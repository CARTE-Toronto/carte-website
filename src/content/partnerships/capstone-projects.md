If you have an applied AI research project but limited budget for sponsored research, consider engaging upper-year undergraduate students through capstone design projects.

**How it works:**
- You propose a real-world problem or challenge
- Student teams work on the project over a semester
- Faculty supervision ensures quality and rigor
- You gain fresh perspectives and potential solutions

This is a great way to explore AI applications while connecting with emerging talent.
