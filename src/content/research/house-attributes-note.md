This conference note presents an early demonstration of using deep learning to predict house-level attributes directly from images. By showing that neural networks can reliably infer characteristics such as size and type from visual data, the work provides a proof-of-concept foundation that motivates later, more comprehensive studies on residential building attributes and their implications for sustainable urban planning.
