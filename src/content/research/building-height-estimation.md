This research presents a streamlined method for estimating building heights directly from single street-level photographs using EfficientNet, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture. The approach eliminates the need for expensive LiDAR surveys or complex multi-image photogrammetry, making urban infrastructure assessment more accessible and scalable for cities worldwide.
