This work develops deep learning models capable of predicting key residential building attributes—such as age, size, and construction type—directly from street-view imagery. By automating the extraction of building characteristics at scale, this research supports more informed urban planning, energy efficiency assessments, and sustainability initiatives across housing stocks.
