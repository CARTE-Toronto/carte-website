CARTE focuses on engineering applications and the translation of Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (A/AI) knowledge into real-world impact.

CARTE is therefore building an industry consortium of like-minded partners who are looking to harness the power of A/AI within their industries.

The CARTE Industry Consortium will propose challenging industry-driven problems that will be tackled in partnership with CARTE faculty and students. It will be a vehicle to translate advances in A/AI to diverse industries, help our partners create lasting value, and support the continued function of the Centre.

## Benefits of CARTE Consortium Membership

Depending on their level of engagement, CARTE Consortium Members have access to the following benefits:

### **4-month project**

Each CARTE Consortium Member will be able to define a 4-month project to be worked on by a team of 4th-year undergraduate students as part of their Capstone program, or by other undergraduate or graduate students under the supervision of a faculty member. The CARTE Consortium Member is expected to be closely involved, providing data and other expertise to ensure the project is a success.

### **1-year project**

Where CARTE Consortium Member(s) can provide additional financial resources, CARTE will help match priority research problems with appropriate research faculty and students. A 1-year project will typically involve a PhD student or post-doctoral fellow, under the supervision of a faculty member. Projects can be started at any time during the year, subject to availability of resources including personnel, funds and facilities.

### **Leveraged funds**

Projects that are 1-year or more in length and involve graduate students may be eligible for matching funding from government sources (e.g., NSERC). CARTE will work with the CARTE Consortium Member to maximize the likelihood of obtaining matching funds, as well as the amount of matching funds.

### **Booth at annual research/industry day for promotion and recruitment**

A dedicated table will be made available to each CARTE Consortium Member at, but not limited to, the annual CARTE research/industry day.
