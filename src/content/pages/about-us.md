The acronym CARTE speaks the main elements of the full name: ![](https://carte.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2019/07/CARTE_acronym-300x135.png) A “carte” is also another word for “map”, which is a fitting descriptor for the Centre, since its primary goal is to bring people together and form new connections. CARTE carries out its mission by providing a coordinated, public-facing storefront for A/AI expertise within the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering (FASE) at the University of Toronto (U of T). It is an important vehicle to promote Engineering and its contributions to A/AI externally. It connects academic stakeholders within the Faculty and across U of T, as well as build strategic relationships with global, leading academic partners and external stakeholders. CARTE aims to catalyze collaboration between researchers within FASE who might otherwise not work together, as well as with other academic units and U of T’s affiliated hospitals. Our heightened visibility enables us to cultivate new industry partnerships and attract top Engineering students and faculty. It also enhances alumni and philanthropic engagement. Funds brought into CARTE will primarily be used to support the training of highly qualified personnel including undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows, who will play an integral role in all partnerships and collaborations. The talent pipeline that flows through CARTE will be a key resource for attracting continued industry investment.
