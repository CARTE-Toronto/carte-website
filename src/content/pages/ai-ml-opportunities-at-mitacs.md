[Home](https://carte.utoronto.ca/) » Internship Opportunities with MITACS

As the hub for analytics and artificial intelligence collaborations at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering, CARTE is pleased to share the following MITACS internship opportunities in analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning.

**Before applying, please contact [Wil de Vega](mailto:wdevega@mitacs.ca "mailto:wdevega@mitacs.ca")** **to verify the opportunity you are interested in remains available, and for information on next steps.** 

## Requirements

*   All MITACS internships must have an academic supervisor associated with the project.
*   Master of Applied Science and PhD students are expected to be supervised by their thesis supervisor.
*   Undergraduate and Master of Engineering students who don't currently have a supervisor may be supervised by a faculty member from any department. We advise these students browse the profiles of [CARTE affiliate faculty](https://carte.utoronto.ca/what-is-carte#affiliates), as well as profiles of other University of Toronto faculty members on departmental websites, to find potential supervisors and contact them directly. If you need additional guidance to find a supervisor, please contact [us](mailto:Somayeh.Sadat@utoronto.ca "mailto:Somayeh.Sadat@utoronto.ca").
