# About CARTE

The **Centre for Analytics and Artificial Intelligence Engineering (CARTE)** is the hub for analytics and artificial intelligence (A/AI) translation at the University of Toronto—Canada's top-ranked engineering school.

We catalyze successful applications of A/AI to challenges across industry and society by combining expertise in A/AI with sector-specific knowledge.

U of T Engineering has identified six **Innovation Clusters**, which represent multidisciplinary, advanced research efforts that address a vast range of social, economic and industrial challenges. Categorized within the [Data Analytics & Artificial Intelligence Cluster](https://www.engineering.utoronto.ca/research-innovation/industry-partnerships-with-u-of-t-engineering/data-analytics-artificial-intelligence/), CARTE's research has strong ties and applications across all Clusters.
