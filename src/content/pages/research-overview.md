# Providing direct support for AI and ML research

CARTE capitalizes on Toronto's position as a world-class research powerhouse in analytics and artificial intelligence (A/AI) and its location in close proximity to a wide range of industry clusters, from biomedical technology to advanced manufacturing.

We support basic research in analytics and artificial intelligence (A/AI) methodologies that may have broad application, by driving collaborative research between technical A/AI experts and those in other domains. We seed small-scale research projects and catalyze the launch of large-scale multi-investigator initiatives.

In addition, our in-house AI and ML expert directly collaborates with faculty at the university to accelerate research in these areas.

## CARTE Research Support: Selected Publications

CARTE directly supports faculty engaging in AI and ML research by fostering collaboration with our in-house AI/ML expert. The following papers are published collaborations involving CARTE and our faculty affiliates.

## CARTE Seed: Selected Publications

The primary goal of CARTE Seed is to bring together a pair of faculty researchers with complementary expertise within FASE to build a high-impact project that will eventually secure large-scale external research funding. CARTE Seed funded projects are substantial initiatives co-funded by the Departments of the respective researchers.
