# Machine Learning Bootcamps

As demand surges for engineers who are well-trained in the field of analytics and artificial intelligence (A/AI), CARTE aims to provide leading quality education through our Machine Learning (ML) Bootcamp. The course is designed for faculty and industry partners who want to learn the basics of ML and its applications. Through an immersive, hands-on curriculum, participants will gain an understanding of the fundamental concepts and techniques of ML.

The content of these bootcamps can be modified to suit a particular audience, but they all aim to provide participants with the skills necessary to implement ML algorithms and models. The course will cover topics such as supervised and unsupervised learning, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. In addition, participants will have the opportunity to work with real-world datasets and apply their knowledge to solve A/AI problems.

## Faculty ML Bootcamp

Our 2019 and 2022 faculty bootcamps offered professors from a wide range of fields the opportunity to learn machine learning. Through a series of lectures and hands-on exercises, participants learned how to apply machine learning algorithms to real-world problems. The bootcamp was a great opportunity for faculty members to learn about this cutting-edge technology and its potential applications in their own research.

The 2022 Faculty Bootcamp was run in collaboration with the Data Sciences Institute, which offers information about the bootcamp [here](https://datasciences.utoronto.ca/machine-learning-bootcamp/).
