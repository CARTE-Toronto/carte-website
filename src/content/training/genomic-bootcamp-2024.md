This three-day program was delivered in collaboration with Princess Margaret Hospital and focused on applying machine learning tools to genomic and clinical data.

**Program highlights:**
- Introduction to supervised and unsupervised learning with biomedical examples
- Working with large-scale genomic and clinical datasets
- Building and evaluating models for prediction and risk stratification
- Deep learning techniques for high-dimensional biological data
- Discussion of data governance, privacy, and reproducibility in clinical research

The program was adapted from Carte's established researcher training and tailored to the needs of genomics and clinical teams at PMH.
