We design and deliver customized training programs for research groups including BioZone and The Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellows at the University of Toronto.

Training agendas are tailored to each group's specific research focus, whether that's genomic data analysis, protein engineering, or applying AI methods to scientific discovery.
