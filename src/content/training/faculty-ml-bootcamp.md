Our flagship faculty bootcamp training agenda is revised annually to incorporate emerging technologies in the field. The program takes faculty members from foundational concepts through to advanced topics like reinforcement learning, with hands-on workshops and collaborative discussions throughout.

Past participants have praised the excellent instruction and the opportunity to learn alongside colleagues from diverse research backgrounds.
